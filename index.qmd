I am a _research fellow_ at the [Pandemic Sciences Institute](https://www.psi.ox.ac.uk/) at the University of Oxford funded through a [Wellcome Trust Early Career Award](https://wellcome.org/grant-funding/people-and-projects/grants-awarded/developing-next-generation-epidemiological). My expertise is in _infectious disease epidemiology_ and _mathematical modelling_, with a particular interest in using pathogen and host biomarker data (e.g., _serology_) to understand and track the dynamics of infectious diseases. My publications, review history and awards are listed on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=QroZi-IAAAAJ&hl=en) and [ORCID](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1998-1844).

I completed my [PhD at Imperial College](https://spiral.imperial.ac.uk/entities/publication/9a9c5ecb-3add-42ed-9c76-682d5c9e8727) in 2019 and spent three years as a postdoc at the Harvard Chan School of Public Health. Before that, my undergraduate degree was in Natural Sciences (Zoology) at the University of Cambridge, followed by an MSc in Computing Science at Imperial College.

I'm always happy to talk about infectious disease dynamics (influenza is my favourite pathogen), serology, viral kinetics, inference methods, hiking, squash... or anything else! Feel free to get in touch at [james.hay@ndm.ox.ac.uk](mailto:james.hay@ndm.ox.ac.uk).
